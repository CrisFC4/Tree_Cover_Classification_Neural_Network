# Tree_Cover_Classification_Neural_Network
 
Portfolio project from the 'Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow' path from codecademy. The objective is to construct a neural network model to predict the forest cover type of a certain area based on geografic characteristics (such as elevation, hillshade, distance to water, type of soil, ...). The data was obtained from the US Gological Surve and US Forest Service (USFS). The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from the USFS Region 2 Resource Information System Data.
